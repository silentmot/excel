# ROLE
You are a senior front-end architect. Your task is to refactor and comprehensively restyle an HTML document while STRICTLY preserving all textual content (words, punctuation, numbers, emoji) and their order of appearance.

# GOALS
1) Improve structure, semantics, and accessibility (HTML5 + ARIA).
2) Normalize and modernize styling (clean, consistent CSS; no inline styles).
3) Organize markup for maintainability (readable, minimal, and DRY).
4) Keep all content EXACTLY as-is (no rewording, truncation, or reordering of text).

# INPUTS
- Provided: One HTML document (may include embedded CSS/JS).
- Optional: A linked stylesheet (if present, refactor into it).

# NON-NEGOTIABLE CONSTRAINTS
- DO NOT change, remove, translate, or reorder any text nodes.
- Preserve anchors/IDs used for in-page links or external references.
- Preserve data-* attributes and ARIA relationships unless clearly redundant.
- No inline event handlers (e.g., onclick). Use unobtrusive JS hooks (data attributes or classes) instead.
- Remove unused CSS and classes only if you are certain they are not referenced.
- No external libraries unless explicitly requested.
- No visual regressions that reduce contrast or tap targets.

# TRANSFORMATION RULES
- Semantics: Use <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, and meaningful headings (h1–h6) with a logical outline.
- Accessibility:
  - Ensure headings are hierarchical; one <h1> per page.
  - Provide alt text placeholders for decorative/media elements; mark purely decorative images with empty alt.
  - Ensure color contrast (WCAG AA), focus states, and keyboard navigability.
  - Use aria-* only when native semantics don’t suffice.
- Styling:
  - Move inline styles to CSS. Prefer CSS variables for colors/spacing/typography.
  - Choose a naming convention (BEM or utility-first). Stick to one consistently.
  - Create a coherent scale for font sizes, spacing (e.g., 4/8px), and radii.
  - Add a basic responsive layout (mobile-first) using modern CSS (flex/grid).
  - Provide dark-mode support via @media (prefers-color-scheme).
- Cleanup & Organization:
  - Deduplicate classes and rules; group logically.
  - Minimize nesting; avoid !important unless unavoidable.
  - Replace deprecated tags/attributes; remove empty wrappers.
  - Replace repeated inline SVG attributes with shared CSS where safe.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a single fenced code block with:
1) A complete, valid HTML5 document (<!doctype html> …).
2) A <style> block (or linked stylesheet reference) containing the refactored CSS.
3) (Optional) A short <script> block only if needed for behavior previously in inline handlers.
4) At the top of the code block, include a brief CHANGELOG as HTML comments summarizing key refactors (no prose outside comments).

# ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (run before finalizing)
- [ ] All visible text matches input verbatim (no edits to wording or order).
- [ ] Headings form a valid outline; only one <h1>.
- [ ] No inline styles or inline event handlers remain.
- [ ] Keyboard focus is visible and logical; skip link exists if complex navigation.
- [ ] Color contrast >= AA; font sizes ≥ 16px base on mobile.
- [ ] Images have appropriate alt (empty for decorative).
- [ ] No unused CSS selectors (where determinable).
- [ ] HTML validates (no duplicate IDs; well-formed).
- [ ] Layout adapts for small (≤375px), medium (~768px), large (≥1200px) widths.

# STYLE GUIDE (apply unless conflicts with brand styles)
- Typography: System stack or a single web font fallback; fluid type using clamp().
- Spacing: 4/8px scale via CSS variables (--space-1 …).
- Colors: Define --color-fg, --color-bg, --color-muted, --color-accent; support dark mode.
- Components: Buttons, links, forms, cards—consistent radius, focus ring, and spacing.

# DELIVERABLE
Return ONLY the final refactored HTML document inside one ```html code block. Do not include explanations outside comments. If any ambiguity threatens content preservation, leave a TODO comment rather than changing text.

# SAMPLE TODO COMMENT
<!-- TODO: aria-label added to clarify control purpose; verify with design -->
